# Java Primitive Data Types

## What are Primitive Data Types?

Think of **primitive data types** as the fundamental building blocks of Java programming – like LEGO blocks that you use to build bigger, more complex things. They are the simplest, most basic types of data you can work with in Java. These types are built into the language itself, not created by the programmer.

## The 8 Primitive Types (Like Different Sized Boxes)

### Numbers with No Decimals (**Integers**)

- **int** – Regular numbers like `42`, `-15`, `1000` (most common)
- **byte** – Very small numbers (`-128` to `127`)
- **short** – Small numbers (`-32,768` to `32,767`)
- **long** – Very big numbers (add `'L'` at end: `123456789L`)

### Numbers with Decimals

- **double** – Decimal numbers like `3.14`, `-2.5` (**most common for decimals**)
- **float** – Less precise decimals (add `'f'` at end: `3.14f`)

### Other Types

- **char** – Single characters like `'A'`, `'5'`, `'@'`
- **boolean** – Only `true` or `false` (yes/no)

---

## Simple Examples

```java
// Different types of data
int age = 25;                    // Whole number
double price = 19.99;            // Number with decimal
char grade = 'A';                // Single character
boolean isStudent = true;        // true or false
```

---

## Why Use Different Types?

Think of it like choosing the right container for what you want to store:

- You **wouldn’t use a huge truck to deliver a letter** (waste of space)
- You **wouldn’t use a small envelope to ship a TV** (won’t fit)

```java
byte smallNumber = 10;        // Small container for small number
int regularNumber = 50000;    // Regular container for regular number
```

---

## Key Points

### 1. They Save Memory

- `int` uses less computer memory than storing numbers as text.
- Like using a small box instead of a big box for small items.

### 2. They're Fast

- Computer can do math with primitives very quickly.
- Like using a calculator instead of counting on fingers.

### 3. No Null Values

- Primitives **always have a value** (never "empty").
- `int` starts at `0`, `boolean` starts at `false`.

### 4. Type Conversion

```java
int smallBox = 10;
long bigBox = smallBox;      // OK - putting small thing in big box

long bigNumber = 1000;
int smallBox = bigNumber;    // ERROR - can't fit big thing in small box
int forced = (int) bigNumber; // OK - but might lose data (forcing it)
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using Wrong Size

```java
byte tinyNumber = 200;  // ERROR! 200 is too big for byte (max 127)
int goodNumber = 200;   // OK - int can hold 200
```

### 2. Forgetting Decimal Point

```java
double price = 10;      // OK - becomes 10.0
double price = 10.50;   // Better - clearly shows it's decimal
```

### 3. Character vs String Confusion

```java
char singleLetter = 'A';        // Single quotes for ONE character
String manyLetters = "Hello";   // Double quotes for WORDS
```

## Memory Usage (Like Box Sizes)

| Type    | Memory Size  | What It's Good For                |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| byte    | Tiny box     | Ages, small counters              |
| int     | Medium box   | Most whole numbers                |
| long    | Big box      | Very large numbers                |
| double  | Medium box   | Prices, measurements              |
| char    | Small box    | Single letters/symbols            |
| boolean | Tiny box     | Yes/No questions                  |

## Practical Examples 

```java
// Student information system
int studentAge = 20;
double gpa = 3.75;
char letterGrade = 'B';
boolean isGraduated = false;
byte numberOfClasses = 5;

// Simple calculator
int firstNumber = 10;
int secondNumber = 5;
int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;        // 15
double average = sum / 2.0;                  // 7.5
```

## When You Get More Advanced

Later, you'll learn about:

- **Wrapper Classes** (`Integer`, `Double`, etc.) – like gift boxes around primitives
- **Collections** (Lists, Maps) – which need wrapper classes
- **Performance optimization** – when primitives make your program faster

---

## Remember This!

- **Start simple** – use `int` for whole numbers, `double` for decimals
- **Choose the right size** – don’t use `long` if `int` works fine
- **Primitives are fast and efficient** – perfect for math and counters
- **They always have values** – never worry about them being "empty"

---

> Think of primitives as your **basic tools** – like having a hammer, screwdriver, and wrench. You’ll use them in almost every Java program you write!

## 🎉 Bonus: Quick Reference Table

| Data Type | Example Value | Range / Size                | Typical Use Case        |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| byte      | 127          | -128 to 127 (1 byte)        | Small counters, flags  |
| short     | 32000        | -32,768 to 32,767 (2 bytes) | Medium-size numbers    |
| int       | 100000       | -2B to 2B (4 bytes)         | Most whole numbers     |
| long      | 5_000_000L   | Huge! (8 bytes)             | Big counts, timestamps |
| float     | 3.14f        | 6-7 decimal digits (4 bytes)| Approximate decimals   |
| double    | 2.71828      | 15 decimal digits (8 bytes) | Precise decimals       |
| char      | 'Z'          | Unicode character (2 bytes) | Single letters/symbols |
| boolean   | true         | true/false (1 bit/byte)     | Yes/No flags           |

## 🏆 Declaration Summary

- **Declare** variables using the type, then the name, then the value:
  ```java
  int score = 100;
  double price = 19.99;
  char symbol = '@';
  boolean isActive = false;
  ```
